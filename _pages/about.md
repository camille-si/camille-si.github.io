Hi ! I'm a PhD student in security and privacy for XR at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway. I work in the Department of Information Security and Communication Technology. My research aims to understand the way security, privacy and usability interact in immersive technologies, qin order to provide XR experiences that are both secure and human-centered. My PhD is a part of NTNU's <a href='https://www.ntnu.edu/perseus/'>PERSEUS</a> project and <a href='https://www.ntnu.edu/norcics'>SFI NORCICS</a>.
<br/>I received a M.S. in Information Security from the Universit√© de Lorraine and I graduated from the Ecole des Mines de Nancy (Nancy, France). Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a Research Engineer in I-Iot security for CEA-Leti (Grenoble, France).
